bio: "Hi friends! My name is Ava (like “guava”) and what brought me here is a number
  of life experiences and a fascination toward the influence of media and cultural
  norms on our decisions and experiences of sex, love, and relationships. I nerd-out
  on these topics by leading in-person lectures and discussions on college campuses
  and talking about all things sex and love via Instagram (@sextalklovetalk), my podcast
  “Sex talk. Love talk.” (which can be found on Spotify, Google podcast, and Apple
  podcast), and this blog. Welcome and enjoy! \n\nPlease direct any comments, questions,
  and suggestions to sextalklovetalk@gmail.com"
