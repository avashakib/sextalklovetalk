Before we dig deeper into specific questions about lube let’s have a quick overview so you can get closer to finding out which is best for your needs.

##### There are 3 main types of lube. Here’s some info about:

* whether they are compatible with condoms
* if they stain fabric
* how well they work under water
* how long one application lasts
* and if they cause irritations

### 1. Oil-based lubricants:

* _Not safe to use with condoms_ because it degrades latex
* Stains sheets and clothing but remedies can be found online
* Makes penetration easier in water
* Lasts longer than other lubricants, therefore needs less frequent lubrication
* Associated with higher rates of infection. Give it a try and see if it works for you. If irritation occurs- stop using.

### 2. Silicone-based lubricants:

* Safe to use with condoms
* Most slippery lubricant, making it the best option for anal sex
* Stains fabric but remedies can be found online
* Can damage silicone sex toys and can leave sticky residue on body even after rinsing off
* Works well in water
* Does not dry quickly, therefore you don’t need to apply as often
* Most are free of irritants

### 3. Water-based lubricants:

* Safe to use with condoms
* Easy to wash off fabrics with soap and water
* Doesn’t work very well under water
* Does not last very long and therefore needs more frequent application
* Some common ingredients like Glycerin and Paraben may irritate genitalia

It is important to remember that _every body is different_. On paper (or on this screen), it may sound as though a type of lube is perfect for you- you go to try it and it causes an irritation. That’s a sign to give that brand up and try another one, preferably a brand that contains more natural ingredients. Feeling generous? give that hand-me-down to a friend.

\~\~\~

Now let’s get to the questions that I received from our followers!

## Who can benefit from lube?

Literally anyone. Lube can be used during solo sex/masturbation or during partnered sex. People of all ages, types of genitalia, and sexual orientations can benefit from using sexual lubricants.

## Where is it useful?

Lube reduces friction and creates a smooth glide for the inside of the vagina and anus, as well as the outside of the penis and clitoris. It is also helpful for anything else that is inserted inside the body, including fingers, sex toys, cucumbers... you name it.

Lube can help reduce rough and dry friction inside the vagina and anus. Oil-based lubricants (like coconut oil) can also be used to massage really any part of the body, creating non-genital sensation play. Try it out! See what you like and don’t like. _Body massages can be done on your own or with partners._ Just remember to make sure everyone in the situation is on board to have oil rubbed on their body! If you’re not into it mid-session, you have the right to tell your partner you’re not into it and they have the duty to respect your change of mind.

## What’s the difference between internal and external lubricants?

Internal lubricants can be used inside of the body (like the anus or vagina). External lubricants can be used on the outside of the body, like the penis or clitoris.

I’ll break down suggestions based on the type of lubricant and where on the body it should and should not be used

###### Oil-based:

* Internal and external body parts
* Do not use with condoms
* Best option for body massages (ex: coconut oil)

###### Silicone-based:

* Internal and external body parts
* Best choice for anal sex
* Damages silicone sex toys

###### Water-based:

* Internal and external body parts

###### Non-fragrance lotion:

* External only
* Be careful to not get inside of urethra (pee hole)
* Not recommended for clitoris, since the urethra is so close
* Most penises have enough space to not get lotion inside of urethra. Still be mindful.

###### Warming lube (creates tingling sensation- more info in a later question):

* External only
* Clitoris, rim of anus (not inside), nipples, lips of vagina, penis
* Wash off of body before penetration

###### Flavored lube (more info in a later question):

* External only
* For oral sex (penis, clitoris, outside of vagina and anus)
* Do not use inside of body
* Wash off body before penetration

## Does using lube mean I’m not turned on enough?

NO. I was told as a teenager that sexual lubricant is for when “two people who don’t love each other have sex.” That’s bullshit.

Vaginal dryness can be related to a lot of different things. I mean hey, maybe you aren’t turned on! But that isn’t indicated by how wet you are. If you’re totally down for the situation and having a good time but are dry- that’s okay! That’s what lube is for.

## What causes vaginal dryness?

Here are some examples of what can cause vaginal dryness, all of which are unrelated to whether you are or are not turned on.

* Decreased levels of **estrogen**, for example during and after menopause
* When there hasn’t been enough **foreplay** (pre-penetration sensation like kissing, caressing, oral sex, etc). _Your vagina depends on foreplay to let your body know to secrete vaginal fluids, which are the body‘s natural lubricant._ If you’re going from a non-sexual situation immeditately to vaginal penetration, it can feel dry and painful. Try out foreplay. If this still doesn’t get you wet, that’s OH-KAY. That’s what lube is here for.
* Using **condoms** automatically creates more dryness and friction. A lot of condoms are pre-lubricated but it’s usually not enough- so throw on some lubricant. (Do not use oil-based lube like coconut oil or baby oil. They break condoms.)

Overall, **SEX SHOULD FEEL GOOD and be free of pain**. If is not comfortable, you have every right to stop the situation. Lube can help decrease discomfort during penetration sometimes, all the time, or never. Do what you need to do to make it feel good. If it doesn’t feel good- maybe today’s not the day to have vaginal or anal penetration. (Note: the anal gland also can produce natural lubricants. I’ll save that for another post)

_If vaginal dryness and pain/discomfort is a long term issue for you, know that you are not alone. If you are able to seek help from a healthcare professional, I highly recommend doing so. Planned Parenthood is a wonderful resource, with caring support that is understanding of all experiences and financial backgrounds. Are you stuck on what to do? Feel free to reach out to me for advice and/or support._

## Is lube only sold at sex stores?

You can find sexual lubricants at your local grocery store and stores like Target and Walmart. I think I've even sometimes seen it at the dollar store, by the condoms and pregnancy tests. (Side note: Dollar store condoms and pregnancy tests are just as reliable as generic brands.) Sexual lubricants are also at sex stores and online sites... even Amazon.com! Often times, places like Planned Parenthood also give out free lube and condoms if you ask!

## Is there an age limit to buy lube?

There is no minimum age requirement to buy lube and condoms. The store employee technically should not refuse service to you. If they ask how old you are, you do not have to answer. It is quite unlikely that you will be given a hard time but if the clerk makes you feel uncomfortable, go to another store.

## Can I use spit as lube?

Yes, technically you can but it just simply is not as good as lube. First of all, spit can contain bacteria and STIs (sexually transmitted infections) which is better to keep away from your genitals if you do not know the STI status of your partner.

Besides the relevance of STIs, water-based lubricants, which includes your spit, dry very quickly meaning you have to reapply very often, which defeats the purpose of using lube.

If you are not concerned about bacteria/infections caused by spit and there's enough slip and slide for you just from spit, go ahead and stick to that- why not?

## What ingredient should I look out for that can potentially hurt or irritate me?

* **Glycerin**: Common in water-based lubes- Watch out for this if you commonly get yeast infections. It is know to cause yeast infections and Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs).
* **Nonoxynol-9**: Often in spermicides, and sometimes in lube, can cause UTIs.
* **Vaseline** and **baby oil** (petroleum-based lubes): While it may reduce friction during sex, it can also introduce bacteria that can lead to an infection. I would honestly stay away from these completely since there are so many other options to use as lubricants that are much safer.
* **Chlorhexidine gluconate**: If you are having problems with your current lube, check to see if it has this ingredient, which is associated with irritation.
* **Parabens**: There is not much evidence, but this ingredient has been linked to high levels of estrogen which is something you want to avoid. But again, there doesn’t seem to be much evidence.

Ultimately, take notice of your patterns of lube use and your body’s response- everyone’s different.

## I commonly get yeast infections. What type of lube should I use?

Silicone-based lubricants are your best bet. Also try to use natural lubricants. Stay away from lubricants that have glycerin.

## Can lubes that have flavors/scents cause an infection?

Flavored/scented lube brings sugar into the vagina which can cause infections because yeast loves sugar. Flavored lubes are meant for oral sex and are not to be used inside of the body. You can always use it and wash it off before penetration.

Flavored lube with sugar, saccharin, or aspartame should be avoided during penetration. Products with Stevia and Xylitol are okay because they do not feed yeast. _Wicked Aqua_ and _Naturally Yours_ are both flavored products that do not feed the yeast in your body, which causes infections.

## When I use warming lube, I get a nice tingly sensation but then it starts burning. Why?

The key to warming lube is that: a little bit goes a long way! There is a fine line between a nice tingling sensation and feeling like you’re on fire, so test it out with just a little bit at first. It is technically for external use, not internal. It is a great option for the clitoris, outer anus, nipples, and lips of the vagina. If you use it on the penis, make sure to wash it off before penetration.

If you’re feeling curious, go ahead and use it internally. Maybe you’ll like it! But most people don’t. Be prepared for stinging but I guess you’ll never know if you don’t try.

## What’s best for shower sex?

Oil-based and silicone-based lubricants are best when having sex in a setting that involves water. Remember that oil-based lubricants break condoms.
